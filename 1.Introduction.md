### What is javascript data structures
It is a specific technique to organise and store data ina computer so that we can access and modify it efficiently.<br>
It is a collection of data values, the relationship among them, and the functions or operations that we can apply to the data.<br>

### Advantages
* Easy way to manage large datasets.
* Simplifies the processing of data on computer.
* These are essential for designing efficient program algorithms.

### Classification of data structures
  1. Linear
     * Static
         * Array
     * Dynamic
         * Queue
         * Stack
         * Linked List
  3. Non Linear
     * Tree
     * Graph

<br>

* A linear data structure traverse its elements sequentially,
  we can reach only one data item directly.To access other elements, you need the help of base elements. 
* Non linear data structures dont traverse in sequentially. Every data item connects with numerous other items, reflecting specific relationship.
* Static data structures have a fixed memory size example arrays.
* For dynamic data structures, we can modify the memory size allocated to it. Includes stack, queue, linked list
